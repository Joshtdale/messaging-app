### My capstone project for the Awesome Inc. bootcamp

For this project I decided to clone iMessage. 

Why a messaging app? <br>
To be honest, this was not 
my first choice solely because it scared me. The thought of having to figure out how to copy 
one of the most well know applications on the planet was extremely intimidating. Yet it's those very 
reasons that convinced me I needed to do it. I knew getting out of my comfort zone would be the best 
way for me to learn 

Why iMessage? <br>
I think Apple is the king of simplistic design. If you think about all of the features 
that iMessage has and the minimal amount of buttons, it is amazing how they can create a 
user experience that is so intuitive.

Big lifts/challenges: <br>
This project utilizes an npm package called [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) to handle real time updates.<br>
<br>
My wife gave birth to our first child during the last week of this project. As you can imagine 
that really caused me to struggle to get this project to a level where I was happy with it in time. 
I'm not sure how I made it through but I did and I'm excited for you to see the live project.
